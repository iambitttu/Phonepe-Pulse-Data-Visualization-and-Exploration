# PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration

## Introduction

PhonePe Pulse is a dataset that contains transaction data from the PhonePe digital payment platform. The dataset provides insights into customer behavior, transaction patterns, and other valuable information. In this documentation, we will explore the PhonePe Pulse dataset, perform data visualization, and extract meaningful insights from the data.

## Dataset

The PhonePe Pulse dataset is available on GitHub and can be accessed by cloning the repository. The dataset consists of transaction data in CSV format, containing various attributes such as transaction ID, timestamp, amount, and more. The dataset is stored in a folder on the local system.

## Data Extraction

To extract the data from the PhonePe Pulse dataset, the following steps are followed:

1. Clone the GitHub repository: Use Git Bash or any other suitable tool to clone the PhonePe Pulse repository from GitHub.

2. Evaluate the data: Explore the dataset files on GitHub to understand the structure and content of the data.

3. Clone the repository: Use Git Bash to clone the repository to your local system. This will create a local copy of the dataset files.

4. Save the data: Choose a suitable location on your system to store the dataset files. Create a folder and save the downloaded dataset files into that folder.

5. Extract data to CSV: Import the necessary libraries, such as pandas and os. Use the os library to navigate through the dataset folder and iterate over each data file. Open each file and extract the data, saving it into a CSV format file.

6. Convert to DataFrame: Use the pandas library to read the extracted CSV files and convert them into DataFrame objects. This allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the data.

## Data Storage

To store the extracted data into a SQL database, the following steps are followed:

1. Connect to SQL: Import the mysql.connector library to establish a connection with the SQL database.

2. Create a new database: Use SQL queries to create a new database that will store the PhonePe Pulse data.

3. Store data in suitable format: Determine the structure of the data and create appropriate tables in the database to store the extracted data. Map the columns of the DataFrame to the table columns and insert the data into the respective tables.

4. Validate data storage: Execute SQL queries to ensure that the data is successfully stored in the SQL database. Retrieve sample records from the tables to verify the data integrity.

## Conclusion

The PhonePe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration project provides a comprehensive analysis of the PhonePe transaction data. By following the steps outlined in this documentation, users can clone the dataset, extract the data, perform data visualization, and store the data in a SQL database for further analysis and exploration. The project offers valuable insights into customer behavior, transaction patterns, and other metrics that can be used for business intelligence and decision-making purposes.
